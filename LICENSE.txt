                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and
other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure the program
is free for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use
the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also
to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it
to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs,
and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users and
authors, it protects the software from being misused.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

  “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
  of works, such as semiconductor masks.

  “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
  License.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  “Licensees” and
  “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

  To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of
  the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than
  the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a
  “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on”
  the earlier work.

  A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based
  on the Program.

  To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
  would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under
  applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying
  a private copy.  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted
  solely under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed;
  section 10 makes it unnecessary.

  “Source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source
  form of a work.

  A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is
  an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or,
  in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
  language, one that is widely used among developers in that language.

  The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other
  than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
  form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part
  of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use
  of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface
  for which an implementation is available to the public in source form.
  A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component
  (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any)
  on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce
  the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
  the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)
  run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control
  those activities. However, it does *not* include the work’s System Libraries,
  or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs
  which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which
  are not part of the work.

1. Source Code.

  The source code must be made available so that anyone can study it,
  change it, and build the program.

2. Basic Permissions.

  You may run the unmodified Program without restrictions.

3. Warranty Disclaimer.

  There is no warranty for the program, to the extent permitted by law.
  Use at your own risk.
